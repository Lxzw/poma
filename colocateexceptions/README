SAME AS TESTMODULE/INDEPENDENT.

If I put the exception in the same package as MonthlyPaymentScheduleCalculator, it will create a cyclic dependency between calc-impl.jar and loan-intrfc.jar.

To run this sample…

Compile using the build.xml in the osgi directory.
Navigate to the equinox directory and execute the following commands:
sh ./start.sh

Once the OSGi console appears, execute the following:
install file:../bin/loggerconfig.jar
install file:../bin/loan-intrfc-1.0.jar
install file:../bin/loan-impl-1.0.jar
install file:../bin/calc-impl-1.0.jar
install file:../bin/loanfacade-1.0.jar
install file:../bin/dclient-1.0.jar

Now start each of the bundles using the bundle id with the following command (start the dclient-1.0.jar bundle last):
start <bundle-id>

To get the bundle-id, use the following command:
ss

To see the scala implementation:
install file:../../scala/lib/org.scala-ide.scala.library_2.8.0.final-p0002.jar
install file:../../scala/bin/calc-iompl-scala-1.0.jar

Either uninstall or stop the calc-impl-1.0.jar.
start the calc-impl-scala-1.0.jar using the start <bundle-id> command.

Issue the following commands using the bundle id of dclient-1.0.jar
stop <bundle-id>
start<bundle-id>
