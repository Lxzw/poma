Patterns of Modular Architecture code samples.

You can run the build for each of the pattern samples using ant. Just type the following at command line:

ant -f <nameofbuildfile.xml>

If the name of the build file is build.xml, you can just type ant.

A JarAnalyzer target is included in each of the build scripts, but is not invoked by default. To use JarAnalyzer, you'll need to install GraphVix dot. (www.graphfix.org).

Once GraphVix is installed, you'll need to modify the build script you want to execute to point to dot. After you've done that, you can use the following command:

ant <jaranalyzertarget> -f <nameof buildfile.xml>
